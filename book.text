<div class="dedication">

Dedicated to my beloved father 
who encouraged every endeavor of mine 

</div>

<div class="page_break"></div>

<h1 class="preface">Preface</h1>  
Being a mother is one of the most challenging roles that I have played in my life. I'm blessed with two girls, one 5 years old 
and the other about a year and a half. When I had my first baby, I remember being nervous and confused about trying out 
new food for her. I use to consult the doctor, my friends and my family 
members whenever I started a new dish for my baby. I wanted to make sure that she was eating healthy food that was appropriate for her age. After going through this cycle once, I thought it was a good idea to 
document this information so that it could be of use to others. 

So, I started blogging when the baby was about 8 months old and thats when I also shared 10 - 15 recipes 
on my blog. I wrote the remaining recipes in a simple but comprehensive document and I 
must say the document was very useful the second time around.

When I found myself with another baby, ready to be given solids, I realized its a good time not only to update 
the document but also publish it for all moms like me. I also noticed that most people came to <a href='romasharma.com'>my website</a> 
looking for baby food. So here is the list of Indian Baby food I have worked on over my two babies. 
I realized that I either have to put in effort in making the dish or in feeding it. The choice is mine.
Well, I prefer spending time making the dish and feeding her quickly. I don't think anyone enjoys running after the baby convincing him to eat. 
I hope you find these recipes useful and above that I hope your baby likes them.

TABLE_OF_CONTENTS
#Guide to reading recipes
This book has 60 recipes which are divided into sections based on the baby's age. 
To make the most of this book its recommended that you read the phases sequentially from the beginning instead of just the section that is meant for your baby's age group. 
That way you can gather information on how you can modify recipes recommended for a younger age group, to suit an older one.


<a href='#ch_h1_10'>Phase 1 : 6 - 7 months</a>

<a href='#ch_h1_11'>Phase 2 : 8 - 9 months</a>

<a href='#ch_h1_12'>Phase 3 : 10 - 12 months</a>

<a href='#ch_h1_13'>Phase 4 : Above 12 months</a>


Certain recipes contain additional information as displayed below :

#Importance of Breast feeding

When it comes to a nutrition filled diet for the baby, there is no substitute for breast milk. It is rich in nutrients and anti-bodies that gives 
your baby good protection from diseases.
Breast-fed babies are at a lower risk of ear infection, diarrhea, asthma, obesity and lower respiratory infections. They are also 
at a reduced risk of chronic constipation, colic and other stomach related ailments.
It has also been observed that breast-fed babies have a higher IQ due to specific 
proteins in human milk that promote brain development.

Benefits of breast feeding are not limited to the baby. Mothers who breast feed are at a lower risk of cervical / Breast / Ovarian Cancer and Post partum depression.
Feeding the baby generates oxytocin harmone which is a 'happy' harmone. It helps the uterus contract back to its original shape, helps milk flow and also calms 
the mother. Psychologically, the mother and baby develop a strong emotional bond due to skin contact during feeding. It also helps the mother shed any excess weight gained 
during her pregnancy and get back in shape easily.


Exclusive breast feeding is recommended for babies upto the age of 6 months because :

* External feeding stands the risk of infections.
* Any external food reduces baby's appetite for breast milk which is the best nutrition possible.
* Drinking water dilutes digestive juices resulting in less absorption of nutrients from mother's milk. Hence, in this phase even water is not recommended.

Mothers these days are increasingly weaning off their babies at an early age. This is probably because it hinders their professional life or comes in 
the way of their day-to-day chores. However, it is important to realize the long lasting benefits of feeding and try to exclusively breast feed 
the baby upto 6 months. After that, solids can be introduced to the baby alongside breast feeding upto the age of 2 years.

#Introducing Solids

When we start the baby on solids we introduce mono-cereals that is one cereal at a time, which could be rice or finger millet (ragi). We usually 
do not start on wheat or any other cereal which might contain gluten to avoid the risk of gluten allergy.
Its also a great time to start the baby on <a href='#ch_h1_3'>fruits and vegetables</a> recommended for his age group.

Please ensure you give the baby boiled water to drink after every meal of solids. Cool the water to room temperature before feeding.

<a name='4_day_rule'><b>Follow 4-day rule :</b></a>

Solids can be introduced after the age of 6 months by following the 4-day rule. Each time you introduce a new food to the baby 
you need to continue feeding the same food for 4 days along with other foods that you have safely introduced earlier.
This is to detect any food intolerance or allergic reactions the baby might have to the newly introduced food.
Its also advisable to try feeding the food in the morning so you can easily get help during the day (just in case).


<b>No Salt/ Sugar: </b>

Salt or Sugar is not recommended for babies upto the age of one year. Beyond that you can introduce salt or sugar in small quantities.
A baby needs less than 1 gram of salt per day upto the age of 1 year. This salt requirement is met by mother's milk. Anything in excess 
to that received from food could cause kidney damage. Hence, its advisable to allow the baby to benefit from natural salts and sugars from 
vegetables / fruits instead of adding any externally.

Even after the age of one, try to use minimum salt/ sugar in the baby's food. Try to substitute table salt with black salt and sugar with rock sugar (mishri) or jaggery
. Do not add honey to sweeten baby's food till the age of one year. You can try using fruit puree to sweeten the food instead of adding sugar.


<b>Healthy ingredients make healthy food :</b>

While trying out recipes from this book please try to use organically grown fruits and vegetables 
as they are free of insecticides, pesticides and other harmful chemicals. Even wheat grains, rice, lentils, ragi/ finger millet and jaggery are better 
in organic form.

Brown rice is a better option when compared to the regular, polished rice as its only partially milled. The husk is removed leaving the bran and germ layers intact.

After the age of one when you start adding salt in small quantities to baby's food try replacing table salt with black salt. Black salt or *kala namak* 
is an Indian mineral salt which aids digestion. Its cooling properties help cure flatulence (gas) and heartburn. It also acts as a laxative and provides 
relief from constipation.

Ingredients like Whole green moong, Broken Wheat (dalia) or finger millet (ragi) should be used in the sprouted form to increase the nutritive value of the dish.
While green moong grains, ragi, etc. need to be sprouted at home, Sprouted Broken wheat is readily available in organic stores. 
Avoid using canned or frozen ingredients for making baby food as they contain preservatives and lack nutritive value. 
Do not feed the baby any store-bought food containing Ajinomoto (msg - monosodium glutamate), artificial sweeteners or added colors upto 
the age of one.

<b><a name='feeding_bottle'>Feeding equipment</a> :</b>

Avoid using feeding bottles! Babies could quit drinking breast milk altogether. Bottle-fed babies are also at a higher risk of infections.
The biggest reason to not use feeding bottles is that some babies simply refuse to leave the bottle even when they are quite old. They 
could go to the extent of not eating or drinking anything for days simply because they can not do without their feeding bottles! 
To feed the baby its best to use silver or stainless steel cups, plates, tumblers, bowls and spoons.
These are easy to clean and do not require any sterilizing. Some people also like to use high-grade plastic which is also a good option. Care needs to be taken that nothing fragile should 
be given to the baby.

Initially at the age of 6 months when you introduce fluids you can use non-spill sippers with soft pouts to give the baby juice or water. Later, if your 
baby takes a liking to it you can buy another non-spill sipper with a hard pout. Every night you will need to disassemble the sipper and wash it with 
mild soap and hot water.

If, like me, you would like to skip this daily night routine you can use a small-sized stainless steel tumbler to feed milk to the baby. A regular 
tumbler could create a bit of a mess initially though its more hygienic and easier to clean. It also prepares your baby for a smooth transition 
onto the next stage of eating and drinking like yourself. This means lower maintenance and an easier day-to-day life. Not to mention the hassle-free cleaning of glasses 
during travel. 

#Introducing Milk
Upto the age of 9 months its not advisable to introduce any external milk to the baby. At the age of 10 months you can start with formula milk after consulting your doctor.
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula'>Formula milk</a> is evaporated milk powder specially composed to meet the nutritional requirement of babies. Please read the label of the formula milk pack carefully and select one based on your baby's age. You also need to refer to the directions on the pack to know 
the quantity and frequency of giving formula milk. Please consult your doctor regarding this as we don't want to reduce baby's appetite 
for breast milk.

After the age of one year you can introduce cow's milk if the baby has not taken a liking to formula milk. 
Cow's milk has to be homogenized and pasteurized. You will need to boil and cool it before feeding the baby. Milk can be given in the morning, evening and once at night before the baby goes to sleep. 
Warm milk helps fill the baby up so that he can sleep through the night without waking up for feeds at short intervals. If your baby doesn't like the taste of plain milk you can try adding a bit of jaggery or rock sugar to it.

Avoid using feeding bottles to give milk to the baby. You can use a soft pout sipper, straw mug or a tumbler.

#My baby is a fussy eater
Every child has his unique eating habits. We just need to experiment to know what works best for the baby. Some babies like bland food while others like it sweet. Some 
like to be spoon-fed while others would rather eat on their own. As mothers we are all concerned if we are feeding the right type of food in the right quantity or not.
Often even if we manage to make nutritious food its rejected by babies due to unknown reasons. Since babies are unable to speak, what suits them has always been a 
mystery. The best you can do is to observe the baby well when he eats. Make a mental note of the vegetables/ fruits / ingredients he seems to like in his food and 
what method of feeding works best for him. 

Hopefully some of the ideas mentioned here can make feeding food an enjoyable experience both for yourself and the baby :


###Measure the quantity of milk intake :
Ensure you don't feed the baby more milk than he requires at his age as that could fill him up with milk and reduce his appetite 
for food. After feeding milk give at least a 2-hour interval and then offer food. 

###Never chase your baby :
Babies need to eat at their own pace. Allow the baby to decide how much and when he wants to eat. Never run after him with food as you 
could run for a long time without much gain. Sit in one place and try to feed the baby. If he runs away call out to him and ask 
him to come back for a bite. In time he will realize that he needs to be where you are if he wants anything to eat. 

Get a high chair and make the baby sit with you and the entire family at meal time. The baby will notice the routine and soon start responding 
to it. Eat healthy food on the dinner table with enthusiasm. He will find your food interesting and might want to try some from your plate. 
That is a good way of making him try out new food.

###Encourage him to pick his food and eat on his own :
Around the age of one some babies stop responding to feeding only because they don't want to be fed. They like to feel the texture of the food 
they eat and would rather eat on their own. This could be a bit messy initially but it helps the baby develop good eating habits at an early age.
You can place small pieces of soft fruits like banana, papaya or avocado and encourage him to pick it up. Tiny bits of bread, roti and grains 
of rice also work well.

###Calm environment :
Do not allow babies to play games, watch TV or indulge in any other distraction while eating food. The environment has to be quiet so only food is 
on the mind. Do not compel the baby to eat. Force feeding can have lasting effects on the baby's mind which could make him lose interest in eating 
for a long time to come. Allow him to eat at his own pace. He will ask for food when he is hungry.
You can also try feeding him at a friend's place. Sometimes babies get bored of their home and just want a different environment to make their meals 
interesting.

###Dress up the food :
You can try giving interesting shapes to the food so it attracts the baby's attention. You can use molds to shape soft solids like halwa, cookie cutters 
to cut out shapes from bread, roti, etc. You can even try hand molding the dough into animals, birds, etc. before making them into chappatis. I remember 
loving the 'eye' and 'beak' of the bird in chappatis that were given to me. That was the first bit I enjoyed eating.
Pancake molds are available in super markets that can be used directly on the griddle to shape dosas and other pancakes.
Vegetable carving can help you create small carrot flowers or bunny faces using vegetables. You can use your imagination to make things the baby likes 
in daily life. My baby loves dogs and anything that looks like one is yummy.

###Change the taste :
By the age of one the baby's taste buds are well developed. The bland, salt-free food you have been feeding so far might not work anymore.
You might need to mix in some herbs and spices in moderate quantities to make the food tasty. You might want to taste it yourself 
before offering it to him. If you do not find it delicious, chances are neither will he. Ensure you use a different spoon while tasting baby's food. 
Using your spoon for the baby can cause bacteria to enter baby's mouth causing tooth decay.

###No Substitutes :
Its a good idea to experiment with food and try out different types of food for your baby. However, while having meals do not offer any other food immediately after he 
rejects something. Wait for a while, offer him a sip of water and try again. If you immediately try different food it will encourage 
him to reject anything given to him in the hope for something tastier. This is not only tiring for the mother but spoils the baby's eating habits.
Do not offer milk as a substitute for food as that could soon become a habit. Drinking excessive milk in place of food could result in constipation due to 
lack of roughage in the intestines.

###Feeding on the move :
When you need to go out somewhere and are hard-pressed for time it might add pressure on the baby to eat quickly. In such situations, its helpful to 
pack the food and feed it during the commute. If you are traveling in a bus or a car the baby won't have much to do but gaze out of the window. This 
is the time they are bored as they can't really run around and food serves as a subject of interest. You can save time too if the feeding time overlaps 
with the time spent in commutation.

Despite all attempts if the baby doesn't eat over a few days its better to consult your doctor as the baby could be going through some digestive problem 
and could need medical attention.

#My baby dislikes milk

Some babies who tend to like milk too much, reject food and stick to a strictly milk diet. When babies drink only milk they could get constipated easily due to lack of roughage.
You can try tackling this problem by cutting down their milk intake and increasing their finger foods. If they don't seem to like the food initially 
please be patient. They will eat when they are hungry. 

On the other hand some babies don't seem to like the very look of milk. This could make them lose out on vital nutrition required 
for growth and development. Here are some ways of trying to help a baby who doesn't like to drink milk.

###Other forms of milk :
1) You can try making <b>milk shakes</b> by churning up milk with strawberries, banana, apple or any other fruit your baby likes (depends on what is permitted at 
his age. If the fruit is not found <a href='#ch_h1_3'>in the chart</a> please start only after the age of one)

2) Once in a while you can substitute milk with <b>buttermilk</b> (or lassi). This can be made by adding a pinch of salt or sugar after the age of one. 
For a more nutritious option you can try blending curd with mango, banana or sapota instead of adding sugar. Please refer to 
the <a href='#ch_h1_3'>chart</a> and select the fruit depending on the age of your baby. This will make a delicious <b>smoothie</b> 
that is nutritious as well.

3) When neither of the above work you can give your baby bits of <b>cheese cubes or slices</b> to make up for the milk he is not having.
You can try cutting the slices into different shapes with a cookie cutter. You can also try some cheese spread on a slice of Whole Wheat Bread or 
a multi-grain cracker. Another option you can try out is <b>cottage cheese</b> or paneer. Its recommended to <a href='#ch_48'>make paneer at home</a> for the baby. 
It can be grilled or stir fried with some herbs before feeding.

###Different cutlery :
Try using different glasses so that the baby can be distracted by the change and finds the drink interesting enough to try out. 
You can use a transparent one so the baby can appreciate the look and color (in case of milk shakes, smoothies, etc.). Its advisable to 
seal the mouth of the fancy glass with a cling film and prick it in the center with a straw. That will prevent the milk from spilling over.
Avoid using fragile glasses. Stick to high grade plastic or stainless steel.

Baby shops are loaded with fancy tumblers and straw mugs that the baby can hold easily while drinking. Try to pick a new mug for the baby 
or borrow one to see if the baby would enjoy a change.

###Changed Environment :
You will notice that sometimes your baby drinks milk offered at a friend's place and rejects the same milk or food when given at home. 
This is because he is distracted by the new surroundings and finds the food interesting. This is the best time to make him try a 
milk shake. However, this is not a permanent solution. Its just to get him started on something new.

#Home Remedies
All a baby in discomfort can do, is cry. That is the reason why with a little baby at home we often find ourselves repeatedly seeking medical attention. 
When babies suffer from common ailments instead of immediately starting medication its a good idea to try out some simple remedies at home :

###Diarrhea :
Common causes for Diarrhea :

1) A stomach infection or eating certain types of food could cause diarrhea.  
2) Teething often causes loose and frequent motions.  
3) Certain medicines (particularly antibiotics) could trigger a bout of diarrhea. 

To relieve a baby of this condition you can feed the baby with <a href='#ch_8'>applesauce</a>, pomegranate juice, dry toast or <a href='#ch_22'>sabudana porridge</a>. 
Besides these you can give re-hydrating solutions like buttermilk, <a href='#ch_2'>rice porridge</a> and arrow root porridge. To make the porridge you need to boil 
the ingredient with water and strain it. Add a pinch of salt and sugar to it, so it serves as a homemade ORS. 
Please check with the doctor before feeding this solution as it contains salt and sugar, which are restricted ingredients.

Arrowroot porridge and arrowroot biscuits both help in 
reducing the frequency of passing motion. They also replenish nutrients lost during diarrhea.

Curd is also good in relieving diarrhea as it contains the bacteria lactobacillus which aids in digestion. 
Try to give the baby small and frequent meals and sufficient fluids to keep him hydrated.

AVOID : Dairy products (other than curd), fruits, milk shakes and all kinds of dried currants - raisins, prunes, sultanas.

###Constipation :
Common causes for constipation :

1) Baby doesn't drink sufficient fluids in a day. Check the quantity of water being fed to the baby (above the age of 6 months). More 
attention has to be given to the fluid intake on warm days.  
2) A nappy rash could make the baby *control* passing stool resulting in constipation.  
3) Babies who don't eat fruits and vegetables and drink only milk all day could easily get constipated due to lack of roughage in the intestines.  
4) Food allergies could also trigger this reaction. Follow the <a href='#4_day_rule'>4-day rule</a> to narrow down the problem.  
5) Taking certain prescribed medicines could cause constipation. Check with your doctor in this case.  

Give the baby warm water to drink every few hours. 

<a href='#ch_15'>Pureed sultanas</a> can be given in a small quantity (about 1 - 2ml) as its excellent in relieving the baby of constipation. 
Also, effective is a milk shake made out of mango or banana. The same can be tried with prunes which is a rich source of soluble fiber and hence a good laxative 
(Its recommended to use only one sultana or prune at a time to avoid the risk of a diarrhea).

<a href='#ch_3'>Mixed vegetable soup</a> is another drink that provides good roughage and should be given 
to the baby during this time. You can add a sultana, prune or a raisin to the vegetables while boiling. That way the soup will not only be sweeter but will 
also have a laxative effect.
Basically, pureed fruits and vegetables provide good fiber to relieve the baby of constipation.

For babies above the age of one, you can add a pinch of black salt (kala namak) to the food. Black salt serves as an excellent laxative. It 
not only softens stools but also provides relief from intestinal gas.

AVOID : <a href='#ch_8'>Applesauce</a>, white bread and white potato.

###Stomach ache due to gas :
Boil 1/4 teaspoon of carom seeds (ajwain) with a pinch of rock sugar. Strain and feed a teaspoon of this water to the baby about 2-3 times a day 
to relieve the baby of painful gas in the stomach (flatulence).
For babies who have started eating curd, ajwain can be had with buttermilk on a regular basis to aid digestion.

Above the age of one, you can add a pinch of powdered black salt (kala namak) to the baby's food. Black salt is a mineral that provides excellent relief from 
flatulence.

###Cough/ Cold :
Steam inhalation is the best time-tested method of giving relief during a cough. Please remember that what is warm for you is hot for the baby. 
Keep the source of steam at a distance of at least 2 feet from the baby. If baby doesn't inhale vapours easily you can try adding 
a few drops of eucalyptus oil in the baby's bath water. The vapours help relieve the baby of a blocked nose. Ensure that the water doesn't 
enter the eyes as that could cause irritation. 

Turmeric has good antiseptic properties and when mixed with warm milk acts as a good <a href='#ch_34'>cough relief drink</a>. 
The extract of crushed <a href="http://www.ifood.tv/blog/ajwain-leaf-benefits">ajwain leaves</a> (also known as Indian Borage) is excellent for relieving cough and cold. 
It serves a dual purpose as it also prevents gas formation in the stomach (flatulence). 
Heat 4-5 ajwain leaves along with a few tulsi leaves (Holy Basil) on a hot pan, for a few minutes. Grind and extract the juice from these leaves. 
Diluted the juice with equal quantity of boiled and cooled water before feeding the baby. 

To reduce a chest congestion you can tie carom seeds in a muslin cloth, heat it on a 
griddle till warm and press it gently on the baby's chest. Ensure you test the heat on your elbow before touching the baby with it or it could 
get too hot without your knowledge.

Food thats fried, sugary or cold should be avoided at this time. Fruits and vegetables that are rich in Vitamin C are best to fight a cold. 

<b>Fruits rich in Vitamin C are </b>: guava, papaya, strawberry, kiwi and orange.

<b>Vegetables rich in Vitamin C are </b>: red bell peppers, parsley, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, tomatoes, celery and spinach.

###Nappy Rash :
As soon as you notice redness in the baby's nappy area stop using nappies! Thats the easiest way to get rid of a rash. Expose the baby's bottom to sunlight as it helps heal the rash faster.
Do not use wet wipes to wipe the baby more that 2-3 times a day. Excessive use of wet wipes also causes rashes.
Apply some breast milk to the rash. Breast milk has great healing properties and will help the baby feel better quickly.
You can also apply coconut oil or castor oil to the rash, every time you clean the baby.

Avoid giving the baby acidic food like tomatoes, pineapple, grapes, apples, oranges and other citrus fruits.
Also avoid raisins, prunes, sultanas, milk shakes and other food that could have a laxative effect and aggravate the rash.
Using the <a href='#4_day_rule'>4-day rule</a> you could detect which food is exactly causing the unwanted re-action.

Using nappy rash creams can be quite a challenge at this point as the cream gets washed off every time the baby passes urine or motion.
Crystal violet or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_violet'>Gentian Violet</a> is a medicinal dye which is useful at this time. 
You need to apply a few drops on the rash with the help of a cotton bud (otherwise you will stain your fingers!). 
Once applied, it leaves a mark on the skin and stays on even after you clean the baby whenever he wets. The persistent stain of gentian violet on the skin helps cure the rash faster. 
However, while opting for this solution you need to check with your doctor and use a dye that is safe for babies.

If the nappy area has a bright red rash with spots it could be a fungal infection. In this case please contact a doctor immediately as it 
would require special treatment.

> * Please ensure that the above medicinal food being fed to the baby is based on the baby's age.
> * These remedies do not replace medical advice. Please consult a doctor if the problem persists.

#Travel Food
Taking care of a baby can be a monotonous job and soon you could find yourself missing the holidays you once use to take to 
catch on a break. Parents feel anxious about travelling with a baby since its not a good idea to feed the baby anything bought outside. At the 
same time its also difficult to clean the feeding equipment used. Here are some tips to help you feed your baby during travel :  

###Homemade food with long shelf life :
For you journey you can carry *puas* which are sweet pooris. For this you have to knead wheat flour with jaggery syrup into a hard dough. Allow it to rest 
and fry pooris out of this dough. To go with pua you can make <a href='http://romasharma.com/2008/03/20/stuffed-ladys-fingers-bharwa-bhindi/'>bharwa bhindi</a> which is stuffed Lady's finger. This recipe pickles bhindi 
in sweet and sour masalas to give it a long shelf life. Another good dish to carry along with you on journeys is <a href='#ch_60'>thepla</a>. Thepla is a paratha made from fenugreek 
leaves or methi. Methi leaves act as a preservative. They could be a bit bitter for the baby so please try feeding it once 
before the trip.

The above mentioned dishes last about 3-4 days outside the fridge.

###Instant Mixes :
Powders like <a href='#ch_59'>Panjeeri</a>, <a href='#ch_9'>Instant khichdi mix</a>, <a href='#ch_58'>Instant Breakfast Mix</a> are handy during journeys. These could be easily cooked anytime, 
anywhere and could see you through a meal.

###Finger foods :
Finger foods like bread sticks and puffed rice are helpful in feeding the baby as well as keeping him distracted during travel. 
You can also carry fruits like bananas, apples and oranges that are easy to feed whenever required.
If you are travelling by air, its advisable to give the baby something to chew on during take-off and landing to reduce any chances of 
ear pain due to sudden change in altitude. Finger foods should be avoided during car travel to avoid the risk of choking.

###Feeding equipment :
If you have decided not to use feeding bottles for the baby this is the time you will be glad you made that choice. 
Besides the known <a href='#feeding_bottle'>issues with feeding bottles</a> the other problem is that they are hard to sterilize 
during trips. Its easiest to carry a stainless steel tumbler, spoon and cup. You just 
need to keep a scrub pad and a sachet of dish washing liquid to clean them after use. 

###Fluids :
Carry formula mix in dry containers along with a flask containing hot water. Mix the two in appropriate amounts and prepare milk 
for the baby during trips. If baby has not taken to formula milk then carry small tetra-packs of the milk you have started him 
on. Give him the milk to drink in a glass so its easy to clean after using. You can alternately keep disposable glasses and throw 
them after using once.

Carry boiled and cooled water for the baby. Avoid water from anywhere outside. Give the baby plenty of fluids to drink as he 
could get de-hydrated during travel.

> * Never give the baby sprouts, chutney, curd or anything uncooked on trips as that could cause diarrhea. 


# **Phase 1 : 6 - 7 months**
 This is the age when the baby has just started having something other than mother's milk. It's important to give things that are light to digest as well as nutritive.
For weaning off the baby initially we give mono-cereals that is single cereal at a time. So you can start with ragi or rice. We usually don't wean the baby with wheat as it contains gluten and babies can have an allergic reaction to it. We start off with lentils like yellow moong dal that are light on the stomach and easy to digest. 

We also start giving baby fruits like banana (small variety), steamed apple and vegetables like carrot, potato, pumpkin, etc. We consciously avoid vegetables like lady's finger that might have too many seeds or radish, kohlrabi, etc. which might have fibers that are difficult to swallow.
###Sample Routine :
Lunch : mashed vegetable Khichdi   
Evening : mashed fruit / fruit sauce (apple, peach, etc.)    
Night : Stage I baby food mix (2-3 scoops)/  rice porridge/ ragi porridge    


> * Salt is not recommended for babies of this age group.
> * Boiled and cooled water needs to be given to the baby after every solid feed.
> * Continue breast feeding the baby spaced at about 2-3 hours away from solid feeds.

###Mashing of food :
Since a baby of this age doesn't have teeth to chew the food you will need to mash it using a mixer grinder or a food masher and then strain it. Care needs to be taken to try and pass as much food through the strainer as we don't want precious fiber lost in residue.  Alternately, you can just mash it with a spoon if your baby is able to swallow it that way.  

  
  
##Yellow Moong Dal Water
This is the first dal that should to be introduced to the baby as it is light and easy to digest. If baby is fine with this you can next use green split moong dal in the same way mentioned. You can also boil <a href='#ch_h1_3'>recommended vegetables</a> along with dal to increase the nutritive value of the extracted water. 


<IMG SRC="images/moong_water.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1 tablespoon split yellow moong dal
* 1 cup of water


**Procedure :**    

1. Wash the dal well by rinsing it in sufficient water. 
2. Soak dal in water for an hour.
3. Boil it and strain it using a sieve. 
4. Feed the dal soup warm to the baby.


##Rice Porridge
Rice Ganji is effective in relieving the baby from diarrhea. Other re-hydrating solutions are buttermilk, rice ganji, arrow root ganji (use arrow root powder instead of rice and follow the same procedure mentioned below)

<IMG SRC="images/rice_porridge.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**   

* Rice 1/2 cup
* Water 2 cups
* Few drops of ghee


**Procedure :**   

1. Boil rice with water till rice becomes very soft.
2. Strain the water, cool and feed it to the baby with a few drops of ghee.


> * Brown rice is a more nutritious option than the regular polished rice.
> * When the baby is suffering from diarrhea its helpful to mix a tiny pinch of salt and sugar to the above mentioned Ganji before feeding it to the baby. However, since your baby is just 6 months old please consult your physician before administering salt/sugar mix.
> * When you start giving milk to your baby at a later stage you can make the above porridge with milk and a spoon of <a href='#ch_16'>Dry fruit mix </a>to it.     

<blockquote class="nutrition">
<ul>
<li>Brown rice is nutritious as its only partially milled. The husk is removed and the germ layer is left intact.</li> 
<li>It is rich in Vitamin B1, B3 and B6. It also contains manganese, iron, phosphorus and fiber. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



## Mixed Vegetable Soup


Soup is a safe drink to keep the stomach healthy and can be given almost every day to the baby. When babies start taking in new and different types of food they sometimes get constipated. Soup being high in fiber provides good roughage to the baby's stomach and gives them some relief from this problem. Carrot gives this soup sweetness while cabbage makes it mildly saline owing to its natural salts. Pudhina leaves give it a minty flavor which serves as a welcome change to the developing taste buds.

<IMG SRC="images/vegetable_soup.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 2 teaspoons of yellow moong dal
* Few pieces of bottle Gourd (lauki), carrot and mint (pudhina) leaves 
* Few drops of lime juice

**Procedure :**

1. Skin the bottle gourd and carrot. Cut into cubes. Wash well along with mint leaves.
2. Wash moong dal and mix with these vegetables.
3. Add 2 cups of water and pressure cook till dal and vegetables are cooked.
4. Now strain this using a juice strainer. The amount of roughage to keep or leave in the strainer is upto you. You can make the soup as thick as your baby likes.  
5. Add a few drops of lime juice and serve warm.

> * Instead of carrot you can use a small piece of yellow pumpkin to sweeten the soup.

<blockquote class="nutrition">

##Mashed Fruits
<IMG SRC="images/mashed_fruits_stage1.JPG" />

###Banana :
Use the small variety (also called *yellaki*) upto 8 months. Later you can use the regular long bananas.
Bananas help your baby recover lost electrolytes after diarrhea.

* Skin the banana and mash it with a fork.
* Feed before it starts browning.

###Apple : 
Apple is best given in the form of <a href='#ch_8'>applesauce</a>. Please refer to the link provided to know the cooking procedure 
and health benefits of apple.


###Avocado : 
This is the easiest fruit to prepare as its naturally of the right texture. You don't need to cook it or puree it.
Spoon out tiny bits of avocado, mash them gently between fingers or with a spoon and feed it to the baby.
If your baby doesn't seem to like the bland taste you can try adding <a href='#ch_8'>applesauce</a> to sweeten it.

##Mashed Vegetables

All recommended vegetables for this age group like carrot, white potato, sweet potato (shakarkandi), bottle gourd (lauki), ash gourd (petha) and pumpkin 
can be peeled, steamed till soft and mashed before feeding the baby. 

<IMG SRC="images/mashed_veg_stage1.JPG" />

##Ragi Porridge
Ragi is rich in calcium, iron and protein. Besides being nutritious its also gluten-free  making it an ideal choice for weaning food.


**Ingredients :**

* 250 gms whole grain ragi / finger millet
* 1 cup water or milk
* 1/2 teaspoon Ghee

**Procedure :**

**<a name='sprouted_ragi'>To make sprouted ragi powder :</a>**

1. Soak ragi for 12 hours. 
2. Drain it and leave it in a cloth or a strainer. 
3. Allow it to sprout for another 12 hrs.
5. Roast the ragi in a hot wok till the ragi is completely dry. Alternately, spread it on a baking tray and place it in a pre-heated oven at 175 Deg C for 10 - 15 mins (or till its crisp). 
Stir it once in between.
6. Powder it in a mixer jar and pass it through a muslin cloth to sieve out the skin. This powder can now be stored in an air tight container.

<IMG SRC="images/ragi_powder.jpg" />


**To make ragi paste :**

1. When you need to feed the baby, mix 3 teaspoons of powder in a cup of water/ milk and make a paste. Let this mix simmer on heat while stirring it continuously. Ensure there are no lumps.
2. Once you smell a nice aroma of ragi and get a silky texture, add ghee and serve warm to the baby. 



> * Please mix in more ragi powder  to alter the consistency of the paste as you like.  
> * You can also use milk instead of water while feeding an older baby (please check with your doctor before starting milk)

<blockquote class="nutrition">

##Vegetable Khichdi 

Khichdi is a one-pot meal in which rice and dal are cooked together. Here, we have added some vegetables to the khichdi 
to make it more nutritious. You can add any of the <a href='#ch_h1_3'>recommended vegetables</a> based on your baby's age.

<IMG SRC="images/vegetable_khichdi.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 2 teaspoons of yellow moong dal
* 1 teaspoon of rice
* 1/4 cup of Bottle Gourd (Lauki) cubes, skinned
* 1/2 carrot, skinned and cut into cubes
* A small wedge of lime
* 2-3 drops of ghee


**Procedure :**

1. Mix dal with rice. Wash well till milkiness goes away and drain.
2. To this add lauki and carrot pieces. 
3. Add about 2 cups of water and give the cooker 4-5 whistles on medium heat so that the khichdi is completely mashed.
4. After cooker cools boil khichdi in open pan for 2-3 mins.
5. Cool and strain through a soup strainer to make khichdi of desired consistency.
6. Add few drops of lime juice, ghee and mix well.


> * Make the khichdi of watery consistency when this is initially being introduced to the baby. Going forward you can strain it completely to prevent loss of fiber and essential roughage.  
> * Instead of carrot you can add a small piece of yellow pumpkin to make the khichdi sweet. Adding both carrot and pumpkin together 
could increase the nutritive value of the dish but would make it too sweet.

##Apple Sauce

Apple sauce or Applesauce is a puree made of apples. It contains pectin which tends to make stools firm. Hence its effective in reducing loose motions. Apple once 
chopped starts turning brown in contact with air. To delay browning you can soak the pieces in some water (actually, lime water is more effective but we don't want 
to make the apples sour for the baby).

<IMG SRC="images/apple_sauce.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1/4 of an apple
* 3/4 cup water


**Procedure :**

1. Peel and chop apple into chunks.
2. Bring water to boil. Add apple pieces such that the water is just enough
to cover the apples.
3. Now cover and cook on sim till apples are tender.  
4. Drain out the water and mash the apple pieces into a sauce.


> * Do not over cook the apples as they could lose their flavor.
> * You can make the same sauce with skinned and de-seeded peaches.
> * Do not give applesauce to a baby suffering from constipation.

<blockquote class="nutrition">
<ul>
<li>Apple is a good source of Dietary fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C. </li>

##Instant Khichdi Mix (for Travelling)

This mix is handy while travelling with a little baby. Once steamed, it has a texture like that of idly. You can carry an electric cooker, plug it in your hotel room and steam the Instant khichdi Mix. That way you can quickly have the baby's lunch ready
in the comfort of your room. 

Please try feeding your baby this dish once or twice before you leave on your journey otherwise you might find it difficult in a new place if he rejects it.

<IMG SRC="images/instant_khichdi.JPG" />


**Ingredients :**

* 2 tablespoons of yellow moong dal
* 2 tablespoons of rice
* 1 teaspoon of ghee



**Procedure :**

**To make the powdered mix :**

1. Mix the dal and rice. Wash well till the milkiness goes away and dry it in the sun.
2. Heat ghee and roast this mixture in it for about 5-7 minutes.
3. The mixture will start turning light brown indicating its done.
4. Now cool it and grind it to the desired consistency in a mixer jar.
5. Store this in an air-tight container and pack it in your travel bag.



**To make the khichdi :**

When you need to feed the baby, boil a teaspoon of this mix in 1/4 cup water for about 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously.  
You can float the vessel containing khichdi mix over water that is boiling in an electric cooker. You can also boil water in a stainless steel vessel placed over an induction heater and cook the khichdi mix in a similar manner. These gadgets are useful in a hotel room where you might need to quickly cook something for the baby in a hygienic setting.


> * Add a tiny pinch of salt to the khichdi once baby is older.
> * This mix has a shelf life of about a week. If you don't roast the dal and rice in ghee the taste becomes a bit bland but you get a longer shelf life.




# **Phase 2 : 8 - 9 months**
By now the baby is accustomed to having mono cereals like rice or finger millet. Hence, we can move on to giving gluten containing cereals like wheat, oats, barley and semolina. We can also give the baby a combination of different cereals, lentils and dry fruits to provide a balanced diet. 


Baby's food needs to have lumps or soft pieces after the age of 8 months so that a smooth transition can be made from purees to solids. 
This is also around the age when the baby also starts appreciating textures. Hence, its recommended that you avoid feeding the baby with food that is a complete paste. 
Let some lumps be there so the baby can be gradually taught to chew his food.
Please check with your doctor if you can start external milk at this stage. If permitted, you can use milk instead of boiled water in the porridge recipes.  




##Fruit Juice

Fruit juices are a great way of giving the baby something naturally sweet while increasing the fluid in-take at the same time.
However, juice is not a substitute for water. You need to continue giving boiled and cooled water after feeding solids to the baby. 

Juice of seasonal fruits like plum, strawberry and orange can sometimes be a bit sour for the baby. On the other hand sweet lime (Musambi), apple and 
melons are not only sweet but also available throughout the year.

Please refer to the <a href='#ch_h1_3'>recommended fruits</a> chart to know which fruits you can juice depending on the age of the baby. 
Avoid giving more than 150 ml of juice to the baby in a day else he will nurse less and miss out on essential nutrients. 
Too much juice can also cause tooth decay, stomach distress / gas and diarrhea. Always give juice in a cup and not a bottle as it could 
adversely affect baby's teeth.   

<IMG SRC="images/fruit_juice.JPG" />

> * Dilute any juice fed to the baby with equal quantity of boiled and cooled water.
> * Do not add sugar to the juice.
> * Do not use canned fruits to make juice.
> * Mashed fruit is a better alternative to juice as it contains essential fiber.


##Barley Water

Barley contains gluten and so we introduce it after the age of 8 months to avoid the risk of gluten allergy.

<IMG SRC="images/barley_water.JPG" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1 Tablespoon Barley
* 2 cups water
* Few drops of lime juice 


**Procedure :**

1. Wash Barley well. Soak it in water for a few hours.
2. Don't drain water. Pressure cook it for 5 minutes on a medium flame.
3. Strain and feed water to baby with some lime juice.


> * Barley bloats in water so its important to take at least 4 times water as compared to the quantity of barley.

<blockquote class="nutrition">
<ul>
<li>Barley is rich in B-Vitamins, essential amino acids and dietary fiber.</li>

##Mashed Fruits

<IMG SRC="images/mashed_fruits_stage2.JPG" />



###**Melon** : 
Melons are juicy, delicious fruits that are nearly 90% constituted of water. This makes them easy to digest. 
They are perfect for extracting juice although its better to have them mashed to preserve the fiber.
Melons are of two types : 

* Water Melon : The skin is green and flesh is red. Seeds are dispersed all over.
* Musk Melon : The skin and flesh are both light orange in color and the seeds are in the center of the fruit.

Preparing melons for your baby is really easy:

* Just skin the melon, remove the seeds and mash the juicy fruit. In case of watermelon, remove the white hard skin as well.
* Chilled pieces of melon serve as excellent finger foods.
* Extract juice from melon if baby is having difficulty swallowing mashed fruit.

###Papaya : 
Papayas are excellent in relieving constipation. It can cause stools to become yellowish which is all right.
Skin the papaya and scoop out the seeds. Mash the fruit and its ready to eat. Avoid any white, hard pieces that you might come across.
Orange, soft pieces are sweet to taste and easy to swallow.

###Citrus Fruits : 
Oranges could be a bit sour at times so please taste it before feeding the baby.
You can give the baby juice extracted from orange or musambi. Alternately, you can peel the skin of the fruit, de-seed and remove the skin of the pods too. 
Extracting the flesh of the fruit could take some effort but its worthwhile as it contains essential dietary fiber that could be lost in extracting the juice.

> * Papaya should be given to the baby in small quantities as it generates body heat.

##Mashed Vegetables

<IMG SRC="images/mashed_veg_stage2.JPG" />

###Peas : 
Avoid using frozen peas that are readily available in supermarkets. Please opt for fresh peas even though they are seasonal.
Peas should be steamed and mashed before feeding. Remove the skin if its too thick.

###Beans :
Please use green, french beans that are firm but not hard. Hard ones tend to be really fibrous. 
You need to trim the ends of the beans and string them before cooking them. 

###Cauliflower :
Cauliflower should be cleaned in luke warm water. Only the flowerets should be used and the stems could be used in making vegetable stock.
The flowerets can be steamed to softness before mashing. Alternately, once the baby grows older you can cook it in milk till it becomes soft.

###Cabbage :
Small, round cabbages are tastier as compared to the ones with flat heads. Discard the outer leaves and the hard, white core.
Cabbage pieces can be steamed and mashed before feeding.

###Beetroot :
Cut the shoots(if any) and peel the skin of the beetroot.
Steam the beetroot pieces till soft and mash them before feeding the baby.
Beetroot could cause the stools to stain which is ok.

###Capsicum :
Discard the steam and seeds of the capsicum. Cook the pieces in oil or ghee until tender.
Alternately, you can wrap up the capsicum in an aluminium foil and bake it at 180 Deg C for about 20 minutes. 
Then un-wrap, peel the skin and mash the roasted capsicum. 

> * Peas / Beans / Cauliflower could cause flatulence (gas) in some babies, so please discontinue in case you observe any symptoms.
> * Beetroot / Capsicum can have a mildly laxative effect so please avoid if baby is suffering from diarrhea.

> * In step 1, you can add a pinch of salt instead of ragi powder once the baby is older and you start giving him salt.
> * You can feed these dumplings with a few drops of ghee and <a href='#ch_1'>yellow moong dal water</a> so its easy to swallow. 


##Pureed Sultanas
Big Dried Raisins/ Sultanas also known as *Munnaka* in hindi are known to be high in potassium and iron. They also contain fiber hence eating too many can cause diarrhea. On the other hand, when taken in measured quantities its excellent in relieving constipation. If you are unable to find *Munnakas* please substitute them with puree of regular raisins/ *kishmish* or Lotus seeds/ *Makhane* as all these ingredients are helpful in relieving constipation.

<IMG SRC="images/munakka.JPG" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1.5 tablespoons of warm water
* 1 sultana 


**Procedure :**

1. De-seed sultanas.  
2. Soak sultanas in warm water for an hour.
3. Once re-hydrated, they will swell.
4. Now puree them and add in required quantity to baby's food.


> * The pureed sultana is to be added onto baby's food. **Its not meant to be given as a dish in itself **as that can cause diarrhea.
> * Consult your doctor before adding small quantities of pureed sultanas to <a href='#ch_7'>baby's khichdi</a>, <a href='#ch_3'>soup</a> or <a href='#ch_10'>juice</a> to relieve constipation. 
> * If you can not find sultanas, you can use a prune or a couple of raisins instead. Be careful not to exceed the quantity specified as it could otherwise result in a diarrhea.

<blockquote class="nutrition">

* 1 cup walnuts (shells removed)



**Procedure :**

1. Dry roast all the dry fruits separately.
2. Cool, grind and sieve into a fine powder.
3. Store in an air tight container.


> * Use unsalted dry fruits. You can add a 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of this mix to any porridge you make for the baby.
> * You can not keep this mix for more than 2 - 3 weeks as dry fruits release their natural oils and tend to smell soon after.
> * Never feed your baby whole nuts as it poses a major **choking hazard**.

##Semolina Halwa

Semolina (or rawa) halwa is a popular sweet dish made by cooking roasted semolina in hot water. 
However, here its made without any sweetener as the baby at this stage is not ready for it. My baby loves this halwa with sugar 
in it. Small amounts of sugar is permitted for her as she is above the age of one.

<IMG SRC="images/rawa_halwa.jpg" />


**Ingredients :**

* 4 level teaspoons fine semolina (chiroti rawa)
* A pinch of cardamom seed powder
* 2-3 raisins
* 1 teaspoon Ghee
* 3/4 cup of Water



**Procedure :**

1. Heat the ghee. Add cardamom seed powder and roast for half a minute.
2. Add raisins and fry till they swell. Set them aside.
3. Add semolina (rawa) in the same pan and roast on sim heat for about 5 minutes till you get an aroma of roasted semolina. Stir continuously at this stage as otherwise it could stick to the bottom of the pan and get burnt.
4. Meanwhile in a separate container boil water. Add it to the roasted semolina while stirring continuously to avoid lump formation.
5. Stir for few minutes till the mixture comes together. 
6. Add previously fried raisins, cover it and let it cook on sim heat for few minutes.
7. Turn off the heat and serve the halwa warm to the baby.

> * This semi-solid mixture is good for babies during summers or when they are running a temperature.
> * You can use milk instead of water once the baby is above 9 months. At that stage you can also add a teaspoon of jaggery to the water/milk while boiling it.
> * Once the baby is over a year old you can use sugar to sweeten the halwa (please check with doctor before introducing sugar).




##Carrot Halwa

Babies at this age can not be given anything sweet so this halwa (or mash) is a welcome change as it contains natural sweetness of carrots and raisins. It can alternately be made by other sweet vegetables like beetroot, pumpkin or sweet potato. 
If your baby doesn't have a sweet tooth you can use bottle gourd instead.

<IMG SRC="images/carrot_halwa.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 cup grated Carrot
* 1 teaspoon Ghee
* A pinch of Cardamom seed powder
* 2-3 Raisins



**Procedure :**

1. Heat ghee. Fry raisins till they swell. Set them aside.
2. In the remaining ghee fry the grated carrot till it turns translucent.
3. Now add a pinch of cardamom seed powder, previously fried raisins and a tablespoon of water.  
4. Continue to cook till mixture comes together.
5. Turn off the heat. Mash and serve the halwa warm.

> * You can make beetroot, pumpkin, sweet potato or bottle gourd halwa in the same method as above.
> * You can also add <a href='#ch_16'>dry fruit mix</a> to this halwa before serving.
> * Once the baby is over 10 months old you can add 1/2 teaspoon of jaggery and 1 tablespoon of thickened milk to this halwa for a better taste.  (thickened milk is not condensed milk. Its milk which is boiled and reduced to half. It does not contain any sugar.)
> * Please go easy on those raisins. They are rich in calcium and fiber hence having too many in a day could cause diarrhea.

##Healthy Wholesome mix
This is a useful mix that has a long shelf life and can be used to instantly prepare a filling meal for the baby. 
It is particularly good for breakfast as it contains vital nutrients that the child can use all day.


<IMG SRC="images/wholesome_mix.JPG" />

**Ingredients :**

**Wash and Dry :**

* 1 cup whole wheat grains
* 1 cup rice

**Sprout and Dry :**

* 1 cup whole grain ragi/ finger millet
* 1 cup green whole moong dal
* 1/2 cup soya beans

**Neither wash, nor Dry :**

* 1 cup fried gram  (To create good consistency and flavour)

**To make the powdered mix :**

1. Soak soya beans, moong dal and ragi for 8 -10 hours. Drain out the water and allow them to sprout for another 8-10 hours.
2. Wash wheat and rice grains.
3. Dry wheat, rice along with moong dal, ragi and soya bean sprouts by patting them with a dry cloth.  
4. Roast them in a hot wok till completely dry. Alternately, spread the grains on a baking tray and place it in a pre-heated oven at 175 Deg C. Ragi will take about 10 - 15 mins to dry (stir once in between).  Moong dal and soya beans being larger grains will take about 30 - 35 mins to dry (stir every 10 mins). Ensure that you spread the grains evenly on the surface area of the baking tray without any overlap.  
5. Once cool, grind all the grains together into a powder in a mixie jar.  Fried Gram doesn't need to be washed and roasted. It can directly be ground along with the mix eventually.
6. Store this mix in an airtight container.  


**To make porridge :**

1. To make porridge mix 2 teaspoons of the Healthy Wholesome mix in 2 tablespoons of water and make a paste. 
2. Pour this paste into a cup of hot water (or milk once baby is older). Bring mixture to boil. 
3. Cool and serve the baby.
 

 > * Its not recommended to add dry fruits to this mixture during preparation as they tend to release their natural oils and the mixture could have a reduced shelf life.
 However, you can add a previously prepared <a href='#ch_16'>Dry fruit mix</a> to the porridge while serving.

##Cashew and Ragi Porridge
This is the porridge that my baby loves the most. I make it for her at least once a week. I stumbled upon this combination accidentally one day when she was giving me a hard time. She had a bad stomach and was fussing too much over eating food. I found myself in the kitchen every 2 hours experimenting something new. Here is the recipe that won that day. I had to make a note of it immediately and of course, share it with you.

##Sabudana Porridge

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago">Sabudana or Sago</A> is a starch extracted from the pith of sago palm stems. It is commercially produced in the form of pearls and is rich in carbohydrates. In Ayurveda, Sago Porridge is believed to cool and balance one's body heat. (Information source : Wikipedia)

<IMG SRC="images/sabudana.JPG" />



**Ingredients :**

* 1 tablespoon Tapioca Pearls / Sabudana
* 1 cup of water for soaking
* 1 cup of water for cooking



**Procedure :**

1. Soak Sabudana in a cup of water for 3-4 hours till soft.
2. Drain and boil sabudana in 1 cup of water till it becomes translucent.
3. Strain and feed the baby with a few drops of ghee.



> * While cooking the porridge in step 2, use milk instead of water when your baby is older and you start giving him external milk.  
> * This porridge provides good relief to babies suffering from loose motions.  


##Ragi Idly

This is one of the most nutritious idlies possible as its made from sprouted ragi which is rich in protein. This is also why it makes it a filling dish, heavier than the usual rice idlies we eat.  

<IMG SRC="images/ragi_idly.JPG" />


**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup whole grain ragi (finger millet)
* 1 cup idly rice
* 3/4 cup skinned urad dal (white whole grains)
* 1 teaspoon methi seeds 
* Few drops of ghee



**Procedure :**

1. Soak ragi for 12 hours. Drain it and leave it in a muslin cloth or a strainer for another 12 hours till it sprouts.
2. Meanwhile separately soak urad dal, methi and rice for 10 - 12 hours (overnight works fine). 
3. Grind urad dal in a mixer grinder till you get a fine paste. Add methi seeds and ragi and continue to grind into a fine paste.
4. Now add rice and grind leaving rice a bit coarse. This gives the idly a good texture.
5. Leave this batter to ferment overnight with a pinch of salt (check with doctor before  adding salt).  
6. Next day, the batter would have risen so ensure you have used a slightly big container.
7. Grease idly molds with ghee and pour a ladle of batter in each mold.
8. Steam the idlies for 10 - 15 minutes on medium heat.
9. Mash and feed warm with ghee and dal.

> * Dipping idly in dal before feeding makes it easier for the baby to swallow it.
> * You can add <a href='#ch_h1_3'>recommended vegetables</a> like beans, carrot and capsicum to the dal to make it more nutritious. 
> * The <a href='#ch_1'>dal</a> used can be moong or toor based on your baby's taste.

<blockquote class="nutrition">
<ul>
<li>Ragi idlies are more nutritious than rice idlies. Ragi is rich in calcium and protein. Using sprouted ragi increases its nutritional value. </li>

##Yellow Moong Dosa

<IMG SRC="images/moong_dosa.JPG" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1 cup rice
* 1 cup yellow moong dal
* Few drops of ghee


**Procedure :**

1. Soak the rice and dal overnight. 
2. Grind them together the next morning. While grinding, add 1/2 a cup of water at a time till you get a fine paste.
3. Heat a dosa tawa / pan. Spread a ladle of batter evenly on the pan starting from the center, going outwards.
4. Sprinkle a few drops of ghee on the dosa. Let it cook on medium heat till it becomes golden brown.


> * Once the baby is older you can add a pinch of salt to the batter.



##Mini Fried Idlies

After the age of 8 months babies can be given soft dosas, idlies, etc. Mini Fried idlies is a good choice at this point as the size is perfect for babies and it takes lesser time to make than regular idlies. Moreover, adding some vegetables can help make it a nutritious choice for your baby. 

<IMG SRC="images/mini_idlies.JPG" />

For making Paniyaram or Mini Fried Idlies you need to get a stand which resembles a tava with molds in it. This is locally called a Kuzhi Paniyaram stand and can be directly used to cook Paniyarams on low flame.

<IMG SRC="images/kuzhi_stand.JPG" />

**Ingredients :**

* 3 tablespoons of dosa batter
* 1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds (rai)
* 1 tablespoon grated carrot
* 1/2 tomato, finely chopped
* Finely chopped coriander leaves
* 1 teaspoon ghee


**Procedure :**

**For the Batter :**

1. Soak 3 measures of idly rice with one measure of whole, white urad dal and 1/4 teaspoon of methi seeds for about 6 - 7 hours.
2. Grind them into a paste with some soaked poha (beaten rice). Let this batter rest overnight. 
3. The next day add a pinch of salt and beat well in circular motion. Please add a small quantity of salt to the batter (after consulting your doctor). 
4. Use this batter for making dosas.


**For the Mini Fried Idlies :**

1. Grease the molds with ghee. Add mustard seeds and let them crackle.
2. Fill batter in each mold.
3. Garnish with grated carrot, finely cut tomatoes and coriander leaves. Cover the mold with lid.
4. Cook each idly for about 5-7 mins on sim. Flip over, put back the lid and continue frying the other side.


**Variation :**

If this dish is being made for adults :

1. You can add some more salt, finely chopped onions, green chillies and grated ginger to the dosa batter. You can temper the idlies with rai, channa dal and curry leaves. Use oil instead of ghee here.
2. Please try to use dosa batter thats slightly sour. In other words, you can use up the previous days leftover batter.
 


> * Try to use a non-stick mold as otherwise you will need to pour ghee from the sides after filling batter into the molds.
> * My stand's manual advised me to use it only on low flame. Please read instructions on your stand before using.
> * Prick a toothpick in the center of the mini fried idly. Check if it comes out clean. If so, its cooked completely and ready to eat.  Else, put it back in the mould and steam it for few more minutes.
> * You can use finely chopped spring onion or mint leaves instead of coriander leaves for a different taste.



##Puffed rice pieces & other finger foods

On a clean surface near the baby leave 4-5 grains of puffed rice cut in half. If your baby loves putting things in his mouth and you are always on the watch that he doesn't then this is his chance! He will love to pick up pieces of puffed rice and eat it. Puffed rice is safe and melts easily in the mouth. 


Other finger foods that can be given at this age are small pieces of boiled beans/carrots/peas/potatoes, chilled fruit pieces like that of banana/ papaya/ melon, soaked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago">Pearl Sago</a> or sabudana, soaked and boiled green moong dal grains (mash and serve, please read procedure to <a href='#ch_38'>prepare the moong dal</a>).

<IMG SRC="images/baby_puffed_rice.jpg" />

> * Ensure you get a soft variety of puffed rice which is easy to swallow. Try to melt one in your mouth before feeding the baby. 
> * Finger foods need constant monitoring! Please watch the baby so he does not stuff too many pieces at once.   



##Curd Rice

<IMG SRC="images/curd_rice.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1/4 cup Curd
* 1 tablespoon rice (uncooked)
* Few drops of oil
* A pinch of mustard seeds (rai)

**Procedure :**

1. Cook rice in 3 times its quantity of water till soft.
2. Drain excess water and allow it to cool.
3. Mix curd and mash well.
4. Heat oil and crackle mustard seeds in it.
5. Pour tempering over the curd rice.

> * Do not use cold / refrigerated curd. Its best to use freshly set curd.
> * You can add finely chopped coriander leaves, grated cucumber or carrot to increase the nutritional value of this dish.

<blockquote class="nutrition">
<ul>
<li>Curd is rich in Calcium and contains the bacteria lactobacillus which aids digestion. </li>

##Thin Roti layers

This is the time you can feed the baby the same rotis you make for yourself. Its a good break from always making separate food for the baby. You can make your regular rotis with preferably no salt in the dough. Once the roti is ready you need to tear off the thin layer on top of the roti and mash it between your fingers before feeding the baby. My 9 month old would dive like a fish to grab each of these bites.  


<IMG SRC="images/roti_layers.JPG" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1 cup Whole wheat flour (aata) 
* Water (to knead)
* Few drops of ghee


**Procedure :** 

1. Knead the dough with water and allow it to rest. The dough should be as soft as the regular roti/chappati dough you make.
2. Heat the tawa. Roll the dough into round chapattis of even thickness dusting it with dry flour, if required.  
3. Place the roti on the tawa and cook till you see tiny bubbles of heat. Flip over immediately and continue to cook the reverse side in the same manner.
4. Now place the roti directly over the flame and as it puffs up cook both sides of the roti.
5. Once done, take the roti off the heat. Allow it to cool down and tear the thin upper layer.  
6. Mash this layer between your fingers, mix with <a href='#ch_1'>Moong dal water</a> and serve warm to the baby with some ghee. 


> * Step 2 - rolling the dough with even thickness, is an important step as uneven thickness  causes the thinner areas to get cooked faster than the thicker ones. Hence the roti might not puff up on roasting. Even if a roti is rolled out thick its important that it puffs up on roasting directly over heat. The heat contained in steam is high and it ensures that the roti cooks evenly.
> * In case you don't want to puff the roti directly over heat you can also try pressing it with a cloth once its cooked on both sides. (please be careful not to burn your fingers!)




##Upma

Upma can be made from a variety of base ingredients like semolina, wheat/rice/ragi vermicelli, brown/white beaten rice, etc. Using your child's favorite vegetables and alternate base ingredients you can creatively make an upma to suit your baby.


Brown beaten rice is a nutritive option. Its made from <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rice">brown rice</A> which is partly milled. Only the husk is removed whereas the bran and germ layers are intact. The healthiest option of base ingredient is ragi vermicelli although it might not taste as good as the wheat or rice varieties. 

**Ingredients :**

* 1 cup beaten rice / poha (thin variety) 
* 1 teaspoon ghee
* 1/2 cup fine chopped vegetables - carrot, beans, peas, cabbage
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
* 1 teaspoon finely chopped coriander leaves

**Procedure :**

1. Soak poha in water and drain it in a strainer. Leave it for 5-10 minutes till soft. Wash it again if it isn't soft enough.
2. Heat ghee. Crackle cumin seeds in it.  
3. Add carrot, beans, peas and cabbage. Fry till vegetables soften.
4. Add the soaked poha and  coriander leaves to it and mix well.  
5. Cook on sim for few more minutes. Mash and serve warm to the baby.


> * There are many varieties of beaten rice. Here we have used the thin one as its soft and easy to swallow. Alternately, you can use the thick variety by just increasing the soaking time.  
> * The brown beaten rice is a more nutritious option as compared to the white one.
> * Once the baby is older you can add a pinch of salt to any upma that you make for him.

**Alternate Upma varieties : ** Instead of beaten rice -

 * you can use 1/4 cup of roasted fine semolina or *chiroti rawa*. Temper in the same method as mentioned above and add a cup of boiling water. Cover and cook on sim for few minutes.

 * you can use 1/4 cup of wheat / ragi / rice vermicelli. Boil the vermicelli in sufficient water and drain. Temper in the same method as mentioned above and add the cooked vermicelli.

<IMG SRC="images/vermicelli_upma.jpg" />





# **Phase 3 : 10 - 12 months**

You can add a bit of salt  / jaggery for taste at this stage. You can also start using milk for porridges ( formula or cow's milk ). However, please consult your doctor before introducing these new ingredients.
You can make all the porridges mentioned in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 sections, like <a href='#ch_2'>rice</a>, <a href='#ch_6'>ragi</a>, <a href='#ch_17'>semolina</a>, <a href='#ch_21'>oats</a>, <a href='#ch_22'>sabudana</a>, etc. replacing water with equal quantity of milk and adding a little jaggery. 

In this phase you need not mash the food completely. Allow soft granules and lumps in the texture as babies at this age have an urge to chew.
Please try to use organic jaggery to prepare baby's food. This jaggery is made from sugarcane that was organically grown, so its free from pesticides and other harmful chemicals. 
Also, while preparing organic jaggery when the sugarcane juice was being concentrated no harmful chemicals (like sulphur compounds) were added to harden it or sweeten it in any way.  When in doubt, you can test the jaggery by boiling it in a little bit of water. No yellow froth will appear if its clean.

<IMG SRC="images/organic_jaggery.jpg" />

##Mashed Fruits

<IMG SRC="images/mashed_fruits_stage3.JPG" />

###Mango : 
Mango is a delicious tropical fruit that is also known as the 'King of Fruits'. It aids in absorption of iron so it helps to serve it along with other iron-rich food.

The best way to prepare a mango dish is to skin it and cut out the flesh thats further away from the seed. 
The fruit pieces can then be mashed or pureed with milk to be served as a yummy milk shake.
Avoid using mangoes that are fibrous otherwise they will have to be strained and used.
You will need to taste a piece to ensure its sweet as a partly sour one could cause a bad throat.
> * If you find baby's motions becoming runny or if you suspect a nappy rash as result of feeding mangoes please discontinue immediately.
> * Avoid Mango if baby is suffering from diarrhea. 


###Sapodilla (Sapota): 
Sapota or *Chiku* as its locally known in some places, is also a tropical fruit. You need to pick sapotas that are soft and have a light brown flesh. 
These are the ones that are sweet and easy to swallow. Avoid sapotas that are hard on pressing or have a flesh thats slightly white.
It needs to be peeled and de-seeded. It can then be mashed and served.

> * Avoid Sapota if baby is suffering from diarrhea.

</ul>
</blockquote>

##Mashed Vegetables

<IMG SRC="images/mashed_veg_stage3.JPG" />


###Tomato :
Tomato can be introduced only after the age of 10 months as they are quite acidic in nature and can cause reactions like rash in nappy area or around the mouth.
Tomatoes should not be fed raw. Its always better to cook them before feeding as it reduces the chances of any reactions.

You can finely chop tomatoes and cook them in a little bit of oil/ghee. Alternately, you can boil and mash them to make a soup.
You need not necessarily peel them but if you want to, you can just blanch them for a minute in boiling hot water followed by a dip in ice cold water.
This will make the skin peel right off and you can then use the mashed tomato in your cooking.

###Spinach :
Spinach contains high level of nitrates. Hence, its advisable to wait until the baby is 10 months of age before introducing it.
Although Spinach is rich in Calcium and Iron, the oxalates in spinach inhibit their absorption by the body. 

To prepare spinach you need to start with washing it well. You can immerse it in a big bowl of water and gently rub it till the dirt 
is removed from the leaves. Repeat this procedure minimum 3 times to ensure you have got all the mud and dirt out. 
Trim and discard any thick stems along with the roots. Use only fresh, green tender leaves. 
You can finely chop the leaves and cook them in a wok till they become soft. You can then puree them and serve. 
 
###Lady's finger :
Lady's finger or Okra as its commonly known, is a vegetable that needs careful selection. Its always advisable to pick small, thin and 
tender fingers as compared to the hard, longer ones. You need to trim off the head and tail of the okra and chop it into small pieces.
Ensure the Okra selected doesn't have big seeds or fibrous skin. The sliminess in Okra helps relieve constipation.

To prepare Okra you need to just sauté it in a little bit of oil or ghee till it becomes soft. 

###Eggplant :
Eggplant or Brinjal is available in a variety of forms - large, purple ones, baby-sized ones and even thin, green ones. You can select any one 
you like as long as they are firm and don't have big seeds. Check for a dark, black spot on the surface on the brinjal. A point at which 
the brinjal looks like it has been pressed. If it has one, its possible that the brinjal has a tiny worm in it. Please avoid using any such brinjals.

The large, purple ones can be roasted directly over flame. You can then
remove the stem and peel it soon after. Mash up the soft flesh and sauté it further in some olive oil before serving.
The smaller varieties of brinjal can be peeled after removing the stem. You can then cut them into small pieces and 
sauté them in some oil till soft.


> * Avoid Okra if baby is suffering from diarrhea.
> * Eggplant can sometimes cause flatulence (gas) in babies. Please discontinue in case you observe any symptoms.

##Sprouted Dalia kheer
Sprouted Broken wheat appears as dry short granules of wheat. Its commonly available in organic food stores. Its a healthier option as compared to plain broken wheat (*dalia* in Hindi). You can also try to <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.doctorgrandmas.com/library/wheat-berries/how-to-sprout-wheat/">sprout wheat grains</A></U></FONT> yourself. This takes about 2-3 days and a bit of effort in changing the water from time to time. However, freshly sprouted wheat is a far healthier option. Once wheat germinates, grind it and roast the paste in ghee till its dry. Add boiled milk and follow the rest of the procedure in the same manner as given below. If you grind the wheat germs fine and don't thicken the milk too much it can also be had as a healthy drink, not only for babies but also for adults. Please remember that whatever quantity of wheat seeds you take it will swell to four times on germinating.

<IMG SRC="images/dalia_kheer.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 2 teaspoons of Sprouted Broken Wheat (dalia)
* 1 cup Milk 
* 3/4 teaspoon of Jaggery
* 3-4 pieces of Cardamoms 
* 1 teaspoon ghee 



**Procedure :**

1. Roast the sprouted broken wheat in ghee for a few minutes.
2. Separately boil the milk with jaggery till it thickens.  
3. Pour the milk mix on the roasted broken wheat and cook till it becomes pasty.
4. Grind cardamom seeds and add to the kheer.
5. Strain and feed warm to the baby.

<blockquote class="nutrition">
<ul>
<li>Broken wheat is an excellent source of fiber since it contains both bran and germ layers. Its more nutritious 
to use sprouted broken wheat in which wheat grains have been germinated, dried and then broken into short granules.

##Bread sticks & other Finger Foods


Babies at this age have teething problems and their swelling gums always want something to Chew on.  Bread sticks are a great finger food at this stage as the baby can hold it with his hands and can satisfy his urge to chew on something. You just need to be careful that he doesn't take a big bite that could choke him.

<IMG SRC="images/bread_sticks.jpg" />

<IMG SRC="images/baby_bread_sticks.jpg" />

Other than this you can place pieces of cheese, fried gram, low-sugar biscuits like Marie or pieces of his favorite fruit for him to pick and eat on his own. These can be given in addition to the <a href='#ch_26'>finger foods you were already giving</a> the baby when he was younger. 


##Green Moong Chaat

Once moong dal is soaked and boiled it serves as a great pick-n-eat dish for the baby. Gently mash each grain between your fingers and place in front of the baby to eat on his own. If your baby (like mine) loves to put everything in the mouth this is definitely going to be a treat.
You just need to ensure that he doesn't stuff in too many at once. If your baby isn't able to eat on his own its really ok. You can mash and feed him the grains as well. Just that allowing him to eat himself is helpful in making him independent.

<IMG SRC="images/moong_chaat.jpg" />


**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 cup Green Moong Dal
* 1/4 teaspoon oil
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera) 
* A pinch of asafetida (hing), jaggery and black salt (kala namak)



**Procedure :** 

1. Soak green moong dal over night.
2. Boil in water for about 15 - 20 mins till soft (not completely mashed) 
3. Heat oil. Crackle the cumin seeds and add a pinch of asafetida.
4. Now add the moong dal and cook over sim till the dal dries up.
5. Add black salt and jaggery and stir well.  
6. Cover the pan and continue to cook for 5 more minutes on sim.
7. Now turn off the heat. Gently Mash moong dal with a spoon and serve it with curd (optional).


> * This is a great breakfast for adults as well. You just need to use regular salt and avoid the jaggery in this recipe. You can also use onion in the tempering and enjoy this nutritious chaat with curd and sweet tamarind chutney.

<blockquote class="nutrition">

##Cheese Tomato Sandwich

<IMG SRC="images/tomato_sandwich.jpg" />

**Ingredients : **

* 2 slices of Whole Wheat Bread or Ragi Bread 
* 1 teaspoon grated Cheese
* 1/2 teaspoon butter
* 2-3 slices of tomatoes 


**Procedure :**

1. Place the cheese and tomato pieces between the slices of bread and make a sandwich.
2. Heat a pan. Apply butter on the outer sides of the sandwich.
3. Toast the sandwich on sim for a few minutes on each side.
4. Cut the edges of the sandwich. Mash the sandwich between your fingers and feed the baby. 



> * Do not over toast the sandwich. We don't want a very hard, crunchy exterior as that might hurt the baby's mouth. We only want enough heat to melt the cheese.
> * Do not press the sandwich while toasting as that spoils the taste of the bread.

##Sweet Poha

This dish happens to be one of my personal favorites. I remember enjoying it as a child. 
I love dishes like these which are not too sweet and can be eaten as a light yet filling snack.
Also, this is one of those no-cook dishes which can be made on-the-run.

<IMG SRC="images/sweet_poha.jpg" />


**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 cup thick Beaten rice (poha)
* 1 teaspoon grated Jaggery 
* A pinch of cardamom seed powder
* 1 banana (small variety)
* Few drops of ghee



**Procedure :**

1. Soak poha in water and drain it in a strainer. Leave it for 5-10 minutes, washing it once again in between. 
2. Once poha is soft, mix in the grated jaggery and cardamom seed powder.
3. Now mash the bananas into this mix.
4. Serve warm with a few drops of ghee.


> * This dish is really helpful while travelling. Since it doesn't require any cooking it can be made anywhere as long as you carry the ingredients (or at least the main ones like beaten rice and jaggery)
> * If your baby is not comfortable swallowing the thick poha variety please reduce the soaking time and use the thin variety of poha.
> * If this dish is being made for adults you can mix in 2 teaspoons of freshly grated coconut before serving.

* 1/4 cup grated Jaggery



**Procedure :**

1. Soak green moong dal till soft. Drain and grind it into a paste.
2. Heat ghee, fry moong dal paste till cooked.  Stir continuously otherwise the paste might stick to the bottom of the pan.
3. Add cardamom seed powder,  milk and jaggery. Cook on sim till the payasam thickens. If required, add more milk to get desired consistency.


> * This same payasam can be made for adults by replacing a cup of milk with 1/2 cup of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of milk in the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> step. In this case, the jaggery quantity can be increased or replaced with sugar as per taste.



##Sultana Porridge

This porridge helps relieve babies of constipation. 

**Ingredients :**

* 1 cup Milk
* 3/4 teaspoon <a href='#ch_15'>pureed sultana</a> (big dried raisin) 
* A pinch of jaggery (optional)
* A pinch of cardamom seed powder



**Procedure :**

2. Add pureed sultanas to the cooled milk.  
3. Sprinkle cardamom seed powder in the porridge and serve.


> * Don't boil raisins with milk. If raisins are sour the milk could curdle.
> * If the sultanas are sufficiently sweet you can skip the jaggery.
> * If your baby is suffering from constipation you can add pureed sultanas to any food you are feeding him like <a href='#ch_7'>khichdi</a>, soup, juce, etc.




##Teething Biscuits


Teething biscuits should be introduced to the baby once he can chew his food well. Chewing on teething biscuits can give some relief to the itching gums of the baby. However, please ensure he is sitting upright and doesn't bite too big a piece to avoid choking on it.
Bread / Soup sticks also serve as excellent teething biscuits. While using ready-made ones go over the ingredients and if you find sugar, egg or any other unknown ingredient please discuss with your doctor. Try to use the short, fat bread sticks as thin long ones could go far into the mouth.

<IMG SRC="images/teething_biscuits.jpg" />

# **Phase 4 : Above 12 months**
Congratulations!! Your baby is now one year old. You have successfully reached the end of a long year which raises doubts on what to feed. Now your baby can eat everything you make for yourself with the exception of things that are too oily or spicy. From here on, it also becomes a little easier to travel as you can start giving some bland, steamed dishes like idlies or plain rice when you go out. Just ensure not to give the baby water, milk, curd, chutneys, sprouts or anything uncooked from restaurants.  
Here I've provided some healthy options for your baby at this stage. I hope you have enjoyed the journey so far. Your little one is soon going to make you run all over the house so please take good care of yourself as well.

##Palak Paratha


This paratha is packed with the goodness of palak. Layers of this paratha can be opened up and small pieces of each thin layer can be mashed between fingers before feeding the baby. 
We have also added some ginger, garlic, carom and cumin seeds to enhance the flavor and to give a good variation to the otherwise bland parathas the baby must have been having so far.

<IMG SRC="images/palak_paratha.jpg" />


**Ingredients :**

* 2 cups whole wheat flour (aata)
* 2 cups chopped spinach (palak)
* 1/4 teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)
* 4-5 cloves of garlic
* A tiny piece of ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
* 1 tablespoon ghee
* A pinch of salt



**Procedure :**

**For the Dough :**

1. Wash palak by rinsing it in adequate water. Repeatedly rinse till the water drained is clear.
2. Grind palak into a paste along with ginger, garlic and cumin seeds.
3. In a dry bowl, mix the wheat flour with ajwain and a pinch of salt.
4. Add the palak paste little at a time into the wheat flour mix and knead till you get a hard dough.
5. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.



**For the paratha :**

1. Take a lemon-sized ball of dough. Roll it into a ball and flatten it between your palms.
2. Dust it in some plain wheat flour and roll it out into a roti using a rolling pin.
3. Now apply a few drops of ghee and fold it into half.  
4. Apply a few drops of ghee and fold into half again. Now you will get a triangular-shaped piece of dough.
5. Dust in wheat flour and roll out to make a paratha.
6. Cook on a hot griddle applying a bit more ghee on the surface of the paratha.  
7. Flip over and cook the other side as well till you get a golden color on both sides.


> * If you are making these parathas for adults you can grind a couple of green chillies along
with the palak paste.
> * You can make methi (fenugreek leaves) parathas the same way. These parathas are a bit bitter so they might be relished more by adults than by babies.

##Homemade paneer
Although paneer or cottage cheese is readily available in the market today its advisable to make paneer at home for your baby. Paneer is a milk product that gets spoilt easily in heat.  During summer months when its being delivered to stores or when there are power cuts, the heat could ruin it. This could in turn cause a stomach infection. Hence, fresh homemade paneer is the best.  So is curd or any other milk product.  

<IMG SRC="images/homemade_paneer.jpg" />


**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 litre milk
* 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice


**Procedure :**

1. Boil milk. Add lime juice and reduce the heat. 
2. Stir till the milk curdles. You know that its done when the whey (liquid portion) looks completely transparent.
3. Strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth.
4. Tie the cloth and hang it till the whey drains out completely. This will take a few hours. For faster results squeeze out as much whey as possible before tying the cloth bag.
5. Once all the water is out, press the residue under a heavy object for 2 hours.  
6. Once the paneer binds, refrigerate for an hour. 
7. Take out the paneer slab and cut it into pieces. Use this paneer in making dishes for the baby.

> * Do not use milk thats split on its own as the paneer won't bind well. Its always advisable to split milk using an agent.

<blockquote class="nutrition">

##Mixed Vegetable Gravy
This is the age when kids become smart and start examining everything they eat. At this stage they sometimes pick certain vegetables like onions, tomatoes or coriander leaves out of their food. To tackle this problem, in this recipe a paste is made of vegetables and cooked to create a gravy so we can make kids eat their food without losing out on the nutrition. This vegetable gravy can be fed along with roti or rice.



**Ingredients :**

* 1 tablespoon Oil
* 1/4 teaspoon of cumin seeds (jeera)
* 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder (dhania)
* A pinch of turmeric powder (haldi)

3. Add mixed vegetables. Fry for five minutes on medium heat till vegetables become soft.
4. Add the paste prepared earlier along with coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt and cook till paste leaves oil from sides.
5. Mix in some lime juice and garnish with coriander leaves.


##Paneer Fingers 

All paneer dishes made for the baby should use <a href='#ch_48'>homemade paneer</a>. Since Paneer is obtained by curdling milk its high in protein and fat. 
Its an easily digestible milk product and can be introduced to the baby, in small quantities.

<IMG SRC="images/paneer_fingers.JPG" />

**Ingredients :**

* 2 teaspoons of ghee
* A pinch of asafetida (hing)
* A pinch of turmeric powder (haldi)
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin seed (jeera) powder
* 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder (dhania)
* 4 paneer fingers (1 inch long pieces)
* Few drops of lime juice

**Procedure:**

1. Heat ghee. Add hing, haldi powder, jeera powder, dhania powder, salt and stir for a few seconds.
2. Add paneer fingers and stir well till the flavored ghee coats the paneer.
3. Turn off the heat and mix in a few drops of lime juice.

> * Add dry powders in medium hot oil and quickly fry the paneer fingers else the masalas will get burnt quite easily.


##Moong Sprouts Bhel


Green moong sprouts besides being rich in protein also contain a good amount of fiber, potassium and B-Vitamins. Although sprouts are best eaten raw, here we blanch the sprouts for a few minutes in boiling water so its easy for the baby to swallow. When mixed with fine chopped salad this serves as a nutritious and filling breakfast.

<IMG SRC="images/sprouts_bhel.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1/4 cup Sprouted whole green moong dal
* 1/4 cup Finely chopped vegetables : tomato, cucumber, coriander leaves
* 1 teaspoon grated carrot
* 1 cup Puffed rice (Murmure/ Kalla puri)
* A pinch of salt
* Few drops of lemon juice

**Procedure :**

1. Briefly blanch the sprouts in boiling water. 
2. Mix with tomato, cucumber, carrot, coriander leaves, puffed rice, salt and lemon juice.
3. Feed immediately least the puffed rice becomes soggy.

> * Its advisable to feed homemade sprouts to the baby. Readily available sprouts sold in the market could be contaminated. Since sprouts fall in the category of uncooked food you can not depend on anything except what is made at home.

<blockquote class="nutrition">

##Sweet dumplings (Gulgule)
*Gulgule* as these dumplings are popularly known, taste particularly good when had piping hot.  Since we can't really feed it hot to the baby we can wait for it to become warm. Please avoid re-heating it, as it could lose its flavor. 

<IMG SRC="images/gulgule.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 cup Whole Wheat flour (aata) 
* 1/4 cup jaggery (or more as per taste)
* 1/2 cup Water 
* A pinch of cardamom powder
* Oil for deep frying


**Procedure :**

1. Dissolve jaggery in water (do not heat).
2. Mix wheat flour, cardamom seed powder into it to form a smooth paste of dropping consistency 
(that is when you pick up the spoon the batter should just slide off the spoon effortlessly).
3. Leave this batter to rest for 1/2 an hour.
4. Heat oil. Deep fry batter into balls at sim heat till they turn golden brown.


> * If the batter is runny add some more flour.
> * Do not fry more than 4 dumplings at a time. Once you remove the dumplings from the oil wait for few minutes to allow the oil to heat up again.
> * Once done, break one dumpling to check if its cooked properly till inside. If it hasnt, please increase the frying time on sim heat.



##Homemade Jam

Jam can be made for babies by boiling fruits with some Jaggery or Rock Sugar. You can also make them without adding any sweetening agent by using fruits like black grapes, plums and strawberries which are naturally quite sweet. These type of jams that contain no sugar are readily available in the market. Do check the ingredients clearly before buying. Do not use jams containing artificial sweeteners. These can be very harmful to babies!

<IMG SRC="images/orange_jam.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 kg Fruit of your choice : mango / strawberry / orange / black grapes / plums / pineapple 
* Rock sugar (or alternately jaggery) as per taste
* 1 tablespoon lime juice

**Procedure :**

1. Remove pips and peels from the fruit. 
2. Heat pulp of the fruit with rock sugar till its soft and can be mashed easily.
3. Taste and accordingly add more sugar (Depends on how sweet the fruit is)
4. Add lime juice into the mix.
5. Thicken till it gets a jam-like consistency.
6. Serve it with some warm Whole Wheat Bread.

##Stuffed Vegetable Paratha


This is a perfect dish to give a baby who refuses to eat vegetables. 
Usually when babies are weaned off mother's milk they tend to prefer eating plain rotis, rice, etc. as they are not used to eating masalas/ spices.
They fuss about eating accompaniments like vegetables or curries. 
That way they miss out on the nutrition part of each meal. 
To counter this problem here we stuff vegetables into the dough before making the chappati.


<IMG SRC="images/vegetable_paratha.jpg" />


**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 cup of finely chopped mixed vegetables: carrot, beans, potato, peas (based on what your baby likes)
* 1 teaspoon finely chopped coriander leaves
* 1 cup whole wheat flour (aata)
* 1/2 teaspoon ghee
* A pinch of salt
* A pinch of asafetida (hing)
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
* 1/2 teaspoon oil

**Procedure :**

1. Heat the oil in a wok. Crackle the cumin seeds. 
2. Add vegetables and fry with salt and asafetida till soft.
3. Mash the vegetables, mix in the coriander leaves and set aside.  
4. Add a pinch of salt to the flour. 
5. Rub ghee into the flour till it gets absorbed.
6. Add water and knead into a soft chappati-like dough.
7. Set this dough aside for half an hour.
8. Now take a ball of dough and flatten it between your palms.
9. Stuff the dough with the cooked vegetables. Close the dough to form a ball again.
10. Dust in wheat flour and roll it into a chappati using a rolling pin.
11. Heat a tawa / griddle. Grease it with some ghee. 
12. Place the stuffed paratha on it and smear some ghee on the side facing up as well. Cook on sim heat for few minutes.
13. Flip over and cook the reverse side as well till it turns golden brown.

##Badam Milk


Almonds or Badams are nuts that are not only nutritive but also very tasty. They are rich in dietary fiber and an excellent source of vitamin E. Almonds tend to change the flavor of milk  hence if your baby doesn't like regular milk you can give this a try. 

Badam milk is a beverage enjoyed hot or cold by adults as well. Too heavy or creamy drinks are not easy for babies to digest hence we partly use water here. Its advisable to sieve the drink before giving it to the baby to avoid a cough due to irritation in the throat. However, for adults this can be had along with the fine almond bits. 

<IMG SRC="images/badam_milk.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 5 Almonds (Badam)
* 3/4 cup Milk
* 1/4 cup Water
* Seeds of 2 cardamom pods
* Few Saffron strands (Kesar) 
* 1 teaspoon of powdered rock sugar 

**Procedure :**

1. Soak the almonds overnight.
2. Skin them and grind with cardamom seeds and water to make a fine paste.
3. Soak saffron in a tablespoon of milk for an hour.
4. Boil the remaining milk. Add the almond paste, rock sugar, saffron milk and continue to boil for 5 more minutes on medium heat. 
5. Strain the beverage and allow it to cool down to luke warm before feeding the baby.


> While making Badam milk for adults :

> * Use regular sugar instead of rock sugar.
> * You can increase the quantity of sugar used and replace water by milk. 
> * Milk can be boiled for longer to make the beverage thick and creamy.
> * You need not strain the beverage before serving.
> * To adults it can be served chilled !

##Baby Rasam 

Vegetable rasam is a nutritive and delicious alternative to the usual dal. Its made almost the same way as we make rasam for ourselves with some exceptions to make it suitable for babies. We freshly prepare a non-spicy rasam powder and use the natural tanginess of tomatoes instead of tamarind. The stock of selected vegetables can be added to this rasam based on your baby's taste.

<IMG SRC="images/baby_rasam.JPG">

For the Rasam powder :

**Ingredients :**

* 1/2 cup coriander (dhania) seeds 
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)
* A pinch of fenugreek (methi) seeds
* 2 teaspoons toor dal
* 1 teaspoon ghee
* A pinch of asafetida (hing)

**Procedure :**

1. Dry roast coriander seeds and cumin seeds separately till they release their aroma.
2. Heat the ghee. Fry methi seeds and toor dal separately. 
3. Once toor dal releases its aroma add some hing and allow it to fry for a few seconds. Quickly turn off the heat so that the hing doesn't get burnt.
4. Grind all the ingredients together into a fine powder. 


For the Rasam :

**Ingredients :**

* 1 tomato 
* 1/2 carrot
* A small piece of cabbage
* Few curry leaves (optional)
* 1/4 cup toor dal
* A pinch of turmeric powder (haldi)
* 1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds (rai)
* 1/2 teaspoon of oil
* 1 teaspoon rasam powder (recipe mentioned above) 
* Few drops of lemon juice
* Finely chopped coriander leaves
* Salt to taste

**Procedure :**

1. Pressure cook dal along with turmeric powder and set aside.
2. Boil vegetables in water until soft.
3. Grind and strain to extract a vegetable stock.
4. Heat oil. Crackle rai and fry a few curry leaves.
5. Add a teaspoon of rasam powder. Add the vegetable stock, dal and salt. Allow rasam to boil.
6. Turn off the heat. Add lemon juice and garnish with coriander leaves.
7. You can feed this rasam with rice after smearing some ghee over it. 

> * You can take out the curry leaves before feeding the baby or alternately add it to the vegetables while preparing the stock.
> * If rasam is being prepared for adults you can roast and grind some red chillies into the powder as well.


##Instant Breakfast Mix (for travelling)


Travelling with a baby can be challenging as you can't feed the baby most of the things you get outside. However, some dishes such as Instant Breakfast mix can be really helpful at this stage. 

<IMG SRC="images/breakfast_mix.jpg" />

Once you make this mix it can be stored in an air-tight container for upto a month. Whenever you need to eat it just moisten it with some warm water, stir in a spoonful of ghee and mix well. Thats the maximum you need to do for a delicious breakfast. You don't even need to turn on the stove! Just warm 1/2 a cup of water for 20 s in a microwave or carry a hot water flask to prepare this dish. In case you can't arrange for hot water at some point, its still ok. Regular water also works fine.

Different ways in which adults can eat this :

1. The most simple is as a Namkeen (Savoury mixture) with tea.
2. You can add finely chopped cucumber, onion, tomato, coriander leaves and eat it like Bhel puri (a kind of Chaat).
3. It can be moistened and had as a regular breakfast

Advantages of this mix :

1. Time saver - Useful when you can't prepare breakfast in the morning rush hour
2. Any place meal - Useful while travelling with a baby and you don't want to give him outside food

Mixing of ghee before eating is important because while roasting we have not added any oil. That makes the masalas settle at the bottom of the poha, not mixing well into the dish. Once you add ghee the masalas will coat the poha evenly, making it tasty.

**Ingredients :**

* 1 cup beaten rice (poha - thin flakes)
* 2 teaspoons ground chutney dal powder (puttani)
* 1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds (rai)
* 1/4 teaspoon Bengal Gram (Channa) dal
* 1/4 teaspoon White Urad dal
* Few curry leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon Dry Tamarind powder
* A pinch of Turmeric powder (haldi)
* A pinch of asafetida (hing)

**Procedure :**

1. Heat the kadai. Add mustard seeds, channa dal, urad dal and allow them to splutter (although there is no oil the hot kadai will crackle them)
2. Add curry leaves, ground chutney dal powder and roast well.
3. Now add Poha and continue to stir till the Poha is crispy.
4. Add hing, turmeric powder, dry tamarind powder and salt. Mix well.

> * Don't cook the poha much more as the masalas will settle at the bottom and get burnt.

**Variation :**

If you want to improve the taste (and reduce the shelf life!) this is what you can do. To the mustard seeds and curry leaves add some roasted and grounded groundnut powder. Instead of tamarind powder use Amchur / Dry Mango powder. Follow the remaining procedure in the same way. This mix will be tastier but will last for about a week. If being made for adults, you can also add some Red chilly powder.

**To Preserve :**

Store this mixture in an air tight container. Use a dry spoon while taking it out.

**To Prepare :**

No need to turn on the stove.
Just dampen the poha mix by sprinkling some warm water and add a spoonful of ghee. Mix well. Be careful not to pour too much water in as the poha might become soggy.


## Panjeeri 

Panjeeri is a prasad that we usually prepare on Janmashtmi and I've noticed that kids really love it. Its powdery in texture and doesn't taste too sweet like most other desserts.
Its also a mix with a long shelf life and hence can be useful during travel. You can carry the panjeeri with you on the trip and mix in some warm 
water to make a paste that the baby can have anytime for a filling meal.

<IMG SRC="images/panjeeri.jpg" />

**Ingredients :**

* 1 cup whole wheat flour (aata)
* 1/2 teaspoon cardamom seed powder
* 1/4 cup powdered sugar
* 1 tablespoon ghee

**Procedure :**

1. Heat ghee in a thick bottomed non-stick wok or kadai.
2. Roast the wheat flour on sim heat and stir continuously so it doesn't get burnt.
3. Once you get the aroma of roasted wheat flour, add cardamom seed powder and roast for another minute.
4. Turn off the heat and transfer the powder onto a plate.
5. Once it cools down completely mix in the powdered sugar.
6. You can store panjeeri in an air-tight container for about a week.

> * Add the sugar only after the roasted flour cools down else the sugar will melt and spoil the texture.
> * If Panjeeri is being made for adults you can increase the quantity of powdered sugar.

**Variation I :**
#### Panjeeri Halwa
Panjeeri can be stored and used to make halwa at a later point of time.

**Ingredients :**

* 1 tablespoon Ghee
* 2 tablespoons Panjeeri

**Procedure :**

1. Heat ghee. Add panjeeri into it and mix continuously so there are no lumps.
2. Now add boiling hot water to it and stir continuously to form a lump-free paste of desired consistency.

**Variation II**
#### Panjeeri Laddus


Heat ghee and pour over the panjeeri. Quickly bind into balls.
Babies find it easy to swallow small laddus made like this. Some also tend to like the round shape. 

##Thepla

Thepla is a paratha made out of fenugreek leaves (or methi). It lasts for about 4 days and is a blessing to have 
during travel. It could be a bitter for the baby so please try feeding the baby with it 
once before your trip.

**Procedure :**

1. Knead the above ingredients with water and make a soft dough.
2. Take a lemon-sized ball of dough. Dust it in dry flour and roll out into parathas.
